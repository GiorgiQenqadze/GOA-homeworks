       <p>The Mercedes-Benz CLS (initially called the CLS-Class) is a series of executive cars produced by Mercedes-Benz from December 2003 to August 2023.
        The original model was a four-door sedan based on the Mercedes E-Class platform, marketed as a four door coupé.
         An estate (shooting brake) model was later added to the model range with the second generation CLS. All models are available as
          a high performance AMG variant,
         although it wasn't until the second generation CLS that 4MATIC all-wheel drive was offered.
