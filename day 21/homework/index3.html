              <h1>About CSS Histori</h1>
           <h1>Section 1</h1>
           <p>CSS was first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie on 10 October 1994.[24] At the time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-L
            ee at CERN.[25] Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time, and discussions 
            on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web Consortium resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1)[26]
             being released in 1996. In particular, a proposal
             by Bert Bos was influential; he became co-author of CSS1, and is regarded as co-creator of CSS.[27]
            Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)
             in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for the web.[28] One requirement for a web style sheet langu
             age was for style sheets to come from different sources on the web. Therefore, existing style sheet languages like DSSSL a
             nd FOSI were not suitable. CSS, on the other hand, let a document's style be influenced by multiple style sheets by way of 
             "cascading" styles.[28]</p>

             <h1>Difficulty with adoption</h1>
             <h1>Sction 2</h1>
             <p>The CSS 1 specification was completed in 1996. Microsoft's Internet Explorer 3[25] was released that year, featuring some limited support for CSS. IE 4 and Netscape 4.x added more support, but it was typically incomplete and had many bugs that prevented CSS from being usefully adopted. It was more than three years before any web browser achieved near-full implementation of the specification. Internet Explorer 5.0 for the Macintosh, shipped in March 2000, was the first browser to have full (better than 99 percent) CSS 1 support,[35] surpassing Opera, which had been the leader since its introduction of CSS support fifteen months earlier. Other browsers followed soon afterward, and many of them additionally implemented parts of CSS 2.

                However, even when later "version 5" web browsers began to offer a fairly full implementation of CSS, they were still incorrect in certain areas. They were fraught with inconsistencies, bugs, and other quirks. Microsoft Internet Explorer 5. x for Windows, as opposed to the very different IE for Macintosh, had a flawed implementation of the CSS box model, as compared with the CSS standards. Such inconsistencies and variation in feature support made it difficult for designers to achieve a consistent appearance across browsers and platforms without the use of workarounds termed CSS hacks and filters. The IE Windows box model bugs were so serious that, when Internet Explorer 6 was released, Microsoft introduced a backward-compatible mode of CSS interpretation ("quirks mode") alongside an alternative, corrected "standards mode". Other non-Microsoft browsers also provided mode-switch capabilities. It, therefore, became necessary for authors of HTML files to ensure they contained special distinctive "standards-compliant CSS intended" marker to show that the authors intended CSS to be interpreted correctly, in compliance with standards, as opposed to being intended for the now long-obsolete IE5/Windows browser. Without this marker, web browsers with the "quirks mode"-switching capability will size objects in web pages as IE 5 on Windows would, rather than following CSS standards.
                Problems with the patchy adoption of CSS and errata in the original specification led the W3C to revise the CSS 2 standards into CSS 2.1, which moved nearer to a working snapshot of current CSS support in HTML browsers. Some CSS 2 properties that no browser successfully implemented were dropped, and in a few cases, defined behaviors were changed to bring the standard into line with the predominant existing implementations. CSS 2.1 became a Candidate Recommendation on February 25, 2004, but CSS 2.1 was pulled back to Working Draft status on June 13, 2005,[36] and only returned to Candidate Recommendation status on July 19, 2007.[37]</p>
