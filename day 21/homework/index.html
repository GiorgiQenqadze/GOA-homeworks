            <p><b>Wrestling</b> represents one of the oldest forms of combat sport. The origins of wrestling go back around 15,000 to 17,000 years
                 ago through cave drawings in France.[4] Babylonian and Egyptian reliefs show wrestlers using various holds known in the present
                 -day sport. Literary references to wrestling occur as early as the Old Testament and the ancient Indian Vedas[specify]. In the 
                 Book of Genesis, the Patriarch Jacob is said to have wrestled with God or an angel.[5] The Iliad, in which Homer recounts the T
                 rojan War of the 13th or 12th century BC, also contains mentions of wrestling.[6] Indian epics Ramayana and Mahabharata contain
                  references to martial arts including wrestling. The Yellow Emperor fought the rebel Chi You using Shuai
                 Jiao at the Battle of Zhoulu. This early style of combat was first called jiao di (butting with horns).</p>

                 <p>In Ancient Greece wrestling occupied a prominent place in legend, literature, and philosophy.
                     Wrestling competition, brutal in many aspects, served as the focal sport of the ancient Olympic Games.
                      Ancient Romans borrowed heavily from Greek wrestling, but eliminated much of its brutality through implementing 
                      different rules. Wrestling is referenced throughout both Ancient Greek and Roman literature. Many philosophers a
                      nd leaders practiced wrestling and/or referenced the sport frequently in their works, most notably Plato, Socrat
                      es, Aristotle, Xenophon, Epictetus, Seneca, Plutarch, and Marcus Aurelius. Dicaearchus wrote that Plato wrestled
                       at the Isthmian games.[7] Many of Plato's dialogues are set in wrestling schools. Ancient Greek lyric poet Pindar wrote victory odes, grouped into four books named after the Olympian, Pythian, Isthmian, and Nemean Games – Panhellenic festivals held respectively at Olympia, Delphi, Corinth, and Nemea. These odes were composed to honor the men and youths
                    who had enjoyed victories in wrestling, boxing, pankration and other athletic contests.</p>
